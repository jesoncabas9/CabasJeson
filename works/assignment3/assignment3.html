            <h1>Top 1. June 19, 2016, Vs. Golden State Warriors</h1>
            <p>This was an unforgettable seventh game in which the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers put an end to the electrifying <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr> Finals. Perhaps the 27 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists
                and two steals playing away in front of nearly 20,000 people do not indicate career highs for LeBron James. But the important three blocks he made that night were a decisive part in the championship, mainly the iconic block on Andre Iguodala
                with less than two minutes to go, that served to demoralize the opponent. Undoubtedly, it's one of the most exciting plays of all time, which was decisive in the final result, with the Cavaliers winning the championship by 93-89.

            <p>Can you imagine a player missing his first 10 shots? Well, for Lebron, the worst starting streak in his entire career, but his greatness and mental strength to recover from this is notorious, culminating the game with 37 points scored, including
                the three-point field goal to win the game with 36 seconds left, he also contributed with 18 rebounds, 13 assists and three steals. The context for this feat and the result? Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals and a 114-111 win for
                the Cavaliers against the Atlanta Hawks.
