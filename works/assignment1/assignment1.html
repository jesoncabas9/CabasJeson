            <blockquote>
                <p id="topsp">The first big game in LeBron James' career, at just 18 years of age he was able to score 33 points, grab 16 rebounds and dish out seven assists in 55 minutes played, numbers that, despite the fact that the game went to two overtimes, served
                    to begin to demonstrate to the basketball world that a new star of the sport was born. All this effort, however, was not enough for the Cleveland Cavaliers, which ended up losing to the Memphis Grizzlies 115-122.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p id="topsp">The American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida, witnessed the most outstanding performance of King James' career in terms of points scored. In 41 minutes played, he scored 61 points (49% of his team that day), made 22 of 33 field goals
                    for a 67%, that included eight three-point baskets on 10 attempts, complemented with nine free throws. In addition, he grabbed seven rebounds and gave four assists. All this in the Heat's easy victory over the Charlotte Bobcats 124-107.</p>

                <p id="topsp">In the fifth game of the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs and in what was his first postseason experience, 21-year-old LeBron James gave a new demonstration of mettle and greatness by scoring 45 points, grabbing seven rebounds
                    and delivering six assists in 46 minutes played.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p id="topsp" style="font-size: 27px;">In his second year of contract with the Miami Heat, ultimately the champions of that season, LeBron signed one of his most dominant games in the paint, with 18 rebounds, including nine in the last quarter, leaving aside that they were
                    visitors against the Indiana Pacers at the Bankers life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. To highlight, the team came into this game down 1-2 in those conference semifinals, but James put the team on his back, as usual, finishing with 40
                    points, nine assists, two blocks and two steals in the Heat's victory 101-93.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p id="topsp" style="font-size: 28px;">In those same playoffs, LeBron James had another masterful performance. In Game six of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, at the
                    <abbr title="Toronto-Dominion">TD</abbr> Garden, and with his team down 2-3. LeBron recorded an impressive 73.1 field goal percentage (19 of 26), grabbing 15 rebounds and topping off a great night with five assists and a total of 45
                    points scored. LeBron once again pulled out his warrior 's chassis to announce that he was not willing to lose again the chance to be <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr> champion for the first time.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p id="topsp">In the last year of his first stint with his beloved Cleveland Cavaliers, James achieved against the Denver Nuggets, probably his best all-around game, scoring 43 points, grabbing 13 rebounds, dishing out 15 assists, stealing two balls
                    and blocking four. Impressive dominance in all facets of the game without a doubt, but believe it or not, the Nuggets came out on top 118-116.</p>

                    memorable performance took place at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Michigan, whose fans also witnessed nine rebounds and seven assists in 50 minutes of play from the 22-year-old.</p>

                    rebounds, seven assists, three blocks and three steals, LeBron as usual firmly took the reins of the team and in what a way, with a solid victory for the Cavaliers by 112-97.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p id="topsp" style="font-size: 28px;">Can you imagine a player missing his first 10 shots? Well, for Lebron, the worst starting streak in his entire career, but his greatness and mental strength to recover from this is notorious, culminating the game with 37 points scored,
                    including the three-point field goal to win the game with 36 seconds left, he also contributed with 18 rebounds, 13 assists and three steals. The context for this feat and the result? Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals and a 114-111
                    win for the Cavaliers against the Atlanta Hawks.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p id="topsp" style="font-size: 25px;">This was an unforgettable seventh game in which the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers put an end to the electrifying <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr> Finals. Perhaps the 27 points, 11 rebounds, 11
                    assists and two steals playing away in front of nearly 20,000 people do not indicate career highs for LeBron James. But the important three blocks he made that night were a decisive part in the championship, mainly the iconic block
                    on Andre Iguodala with less than two minutes to go, that served to demoralize the opponent. Undoubtedly, it's one of the most exciting plays of all time, which was decisive in the final result, with the Cavaliers winning the championship
                    by 93-89.</p>
